![](https://github.com/YahboomTechnology/Laser-ranging-module/blob/master/Laser-ranging-module.jpg)
# Introduction
This TOF(time of flight) module integrates a laser ranging sensor with a built-in ranging algorithm, which calculates the distance by the time of emitting and receiving the reflected laser. Compared with infrared and ultrasonic modules, the laser ranging module has higher accuracy and faster response speed. It supports PH2.0 cable, DuPont cable, alligator clip three connection methods, compatible with Adruino, STM32, Raspberry Pi and other controllers, and can be used for drones, robots, obstacle avoidance or distance detection and other fields.
# Features
* PCB workmanship is fine.
* The accuracy of ranging is higher and the response speed is faster.
* Three connection methods are supported.
